Using `git pull` with a remote repository URL is not a recommended approach for starting a new project from scratch. The `git pull` command is used to update an existing Git repository with changes from a remote repository. It's not designed to initialize a new project.

Here's the typical workflow for starting a new project from scratch:

1. **Create a New Repository:**
   - You can create a new empty Git repository either locally on your computer or on a Git hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

2. **Initialize the Local Repository:**
   - If you created a new repository locally, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and use the following commands to initialize a Git repository:

     ```bash
     git init              # Initializes a new Git repository
     git add .             # Stages all files in the current directory
     git commit -m "Initial commit"  # Commits the initial changes
     ```

   - If you created a repository on a hosting service, you can clone it to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.

3. **Add and Commit Your Project Files:**
   - Start adding and committing your project files using `git add` and `git commit` commands.

4. **Connect to Remote (Optional):**
   - If you created a remote repository on a hosting service, you can connect your local repository to the remote using the following commands:

     ```bash
     git remote add origin <repository_url>   # Associates your local repo with the remote repo
     git branch -M main                      # Renames the default branch to 'main' (if needed)
     git push -u origin main                 # Pushes your local changes to the remote
     ```

Using `git pull` in this context wouldn't be appropriate because there would be no existing branch or commit history in your local repository to pull from the remote repository. `git clone` or initializing a new local repository as described above is the standard way to start a new project from scratch.
